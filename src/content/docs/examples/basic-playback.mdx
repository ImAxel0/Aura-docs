Here we show how to play an audio file by creating an audio clip from it and adding it to an audio track.

```cs
using Aura;
using Aura.Clips;
using Aura.Tracks;

public class Program
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        AuraMain.Init(); // Initialize the framework

        // Create an audio device using the WaveOut API
        AuraMain.CreateAudioDevice(AudioAPI.WaveOut);

        // Create an audio clip from an audio file
        var audioClip = new AudioClip("path/to/sound.wav");

        // Create an audio track with a name
        var audioTrack = new AudioTrack("MyTrackName");

        // Add the created audio clip to the audio track
        audioTrack.AddClip(audioClip);

        // Start the clip playback
        audioClip.Play();

        // Wait for a keypress before exiting the program
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
```

<Steps>
  1. The framework is initialized with `AuraMain.Init()`.

  2. A WASAPI audio device is created with `AuraMain.CreateAudioDevice(AudioAPI.WaveOut)`.

  3. An audio clip is created from a .wav file.

  4. An audio track is created and assigned a name.

  5. The created audio clip is added to the created audio track.

  6. The audio clip is played.

  7. The program waits for a keypress before exiting.
