## Requirements

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/it-it/download/dotnet/6.0): the framework is built on the .NET 6 version for better compatibility with some of the used libraries, but should also works on later versions, although it has not been tested.

## Supported OS

- Windows

There is no cross platform support as most of the used libraries have partial cross platform capabilities or not at all.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is to install the NuGet package with the NuGet Package Manager you can find on Visual Studio in `Tools` > `NuGet Package Manager` > `Package Manager Console`, running the command below. For others IDE use the relative package manager.

```bash
Install-Package Aura
```

If you are gonna use VST plugins in your app, you will also have to install the `VST.NET2-Host` package.

```bash
Install-Package VST.NET2-Host
```

After installing the needed packages, make your project target the `x64` platform.

<Aside>
  Target platform `x64` is required because the framework was built on that target to support VST plugins. For reference, read the first lines [here](https://obiwanjacobi.github.io/vst.net/GettingStarted.html).
