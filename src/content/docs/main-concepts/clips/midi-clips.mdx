Midi clips are used to load, store and play midi files or generic midi data.

## Creation

To create a new midi clip we need either a midi file or a `MidiFile` instance of [DryWetMidi](https://github.com/melanchall/drywetmidi).

```cs
var midiClip = new MidiClip("path/to/song.mid"); // Creation of a midi clip from a midi file

// Creation of a midi clip from a MidiFile instance of the DryWetMidi library
MidiFile midiData = new MidiFile();
var midiClip2 = new MidiClip(midiData)
```

## Parameters

There are some parameters we can customize.

### Tweakable parameters

Here is list of the tweakable midi clip parameters:

- `Enabled`: changes the clip enabled/disabled state. If the clip is disabled it won't be played.
- `Name`: represents the name of the clip. If the clip is created from a midi file the name defaults to the file name.
- `Time`: represents the time of the clip on a timeline. This isn't used by the framework as per se, but can be useful for the user to define when the clip should be played or where should be positioned.
- `StartMarker`: defines at what seconds the clip playback should start from. Eg. for a midi clip of 30s and a **StartMarker** of 8s, the clip will start playing from 8s.
- `EndMarker`: defines at what seconds the clip should stop playing. Eg. for a midi clip of 30s and an **EndMarker** of 24s, the clip will play from 0s to 24s.

### Not tweakable parameters

Here is list of not tweakable midi clip parameters:

- `Id`: an unique id in the form `5cafb3a8-dba4-47ce-9e58-03d972526c50` that could be useful to distinguish between clips or to the user.
- `FilePath`: represents the file path of the midi file used by the midi clip (if any).
- `CurrentTime`: represents the current time of the clip playback.
- `IsPlaying()`: indicates if the clip is currently playing.
- `Duration`: represents the total duration of the clip. It takes into account starting/ending markers and the speed properties of the clip.
- `IsAudioClip`: indicates if it is an audio clip or not.
- `IsMidiClip`: indicates if it is a midi clip or not.
- `Track`: the track which contains the clip if any.
- `IsInTrack`: indicates if the clip is inside a track.
- `AudioFile`: not used by midi clips.
- `MidiFile`: **MidiFile** instance of DryWetMidi. Contains the midi data which can be modified by the user. (e.g add or remove notes)
- `Automations`: dictionary which contains all the clip automations. (see the automations article for guidance)

## Operations

We can do some operations with midi clips. Here is a list:

- `Play()`: starts the clip playback.
- `Stop()`: stops the clip playback.
- `Seek()`: go to a specific time during playback. (must be between **StartMarker** and **EndMarker**)
- `Split()`: splits the clip in twos at the specified time. Returns a new clip which represents the rightmost part.
- `SplitFromTo()`: splits the clip in threes from time to time. Returns two new clips which represent the middle and rightmost part.
- `CutOut()`: cuts out a part of the clip from time to time. Returns a new clip which represent the rightmost part.
- `Duplicate()`: creates an unique copy of the midi clip.
- `GetDuration()`: gets the real duration of the **MidiFile** instance used by the midi clip.
- `AddAutomationPoint()`: adds an automation point for a parameter at a specified time.
- `ClearAutomation()`: clears an automation for a parameter.
- `ClearAllAutomations()`: clears all automations of the midi clip.

<Aside type="note">
  `Split` `SplitFromTo` `CutOut` work by just adjusting the `StartMarker` and `EndMarker` properties without touching the original file data, so we can always revert to a previous state.

See the examples below for guidance.

  Clips must be inside tracks to be played. (see the tracks articles)

### Examples

For examples of operations on midi clips refer to the examples of audio clips since they work exactly the same way.

## Events

There are some events we can subscribe to in order to execute certain actions when a parameter changes.

- `EnableChanged`: called when the clip `Enabled` property has been changed.
- `EndMarkerChanged`: called when the clip `EndMarker` property has been changed.
- `NameChanged`: called when the clip `Name` property has been changed.
- `StartMarkerChanged`: called when the clip `StartMarker` property has been changed.
- `TimeChanged`: called when the clip `Time` property has been changed.

### Example

In this example we update the `Time` parameter of the audio clip to reflect changes of `StartMarker`.

```cs
var midiClip = new MidiClip("path/to/midi.mid");

midiClip.StartMarkerChanged += (sender, e) =>
{
    double changeLength = e.NewTime - e.OldTime;
    midiClip.Time += changeLength;
};

// here midiClip.Time is still 0
midiClip.StartMarker = 2;
// here midiClip.Time is 2
```
