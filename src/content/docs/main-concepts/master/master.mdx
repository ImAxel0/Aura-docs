The master mixer is the audio endpoint that sends the sound to the output device.

It also stores all tracks and shares some of their controls like volume and panning.

## Parameters

There are two parameters we can tweak:

- `Volume`: volume of the master mixer in dB. Ranges from -90 (completely silent) to +6 (clipping). Default value is zero.
- `Pan`: panning amount of the master mixer (how much the sound should be heard from left and right). Ranges from -50 (100% left) to +50 (100% right). Default value is zero.

## Operations

These are the operations we can do with the master:

- `AddTrack()`: adds a track to the master mixer.
- `RemoveTrack()`: removes a track from the master mixer.
- `RemoveAllTracks()`: removes all tracks from the master mixer.
- `StopSounds()`: globally stop all playing sounds by stopping all clips on each track.

<Aside type="note">
  When a track is created, it gets automatically added to the master mixer.
</Aside>

## Iterating on all master tracks

In this example we iterate on all tracks added to the master mixer and print the name of each of their clip.

```cs
foreach (var track in Master.Tracks)
{
    foreach (var clip in track.Clips)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(clip.Name);
    }
}
```
