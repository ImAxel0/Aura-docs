With built in plugins we refer to classes which implement the `IPlugin` interface and doesn't rely on external VSTs.

They can process the sound by acting directly on the received audio samples and can be added and removed from tracks like VSTs.

The framework offers two built in plugins for common effects:

<Steps>

1. **Utility**: plugin which controls volume, pan, width and channel polarity of the provided audio source.
2. **PitchShifter**: plugin which controls the pitch of the provided audio source.

</Steps>

## Example

In this example we create an audio clip, add it to a created audio track, create the Utility plugin and add it to the audio track, then play the audio clip.

```cs
var audioClip = new AudioClip("path/to/sound.wav"); // Create an audio clip
var audioTrack = new AudioTrack(); // Create an audio track

// Create an instance of the Utility plugin and setup some of its parameters
var utility = new Utility() { Volume = 0.5f, Mono = true };

audioTrack.AddClip(audioClip); // Add the audio clip to the audio track
audioTrack.AddPlugin(utility); // Add the Utility plugin to the audio track

audioClip.Play(); // Play the audio clip (clip will play at half volume and in mono)
```

## Extending the framework plugins

The framework could eventually be extended by creating new built in plugins which derives from the `IPlugin` interface.
