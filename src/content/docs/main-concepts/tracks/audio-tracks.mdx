Audio tracks can contains audio clips and plugins, can play and mix multiple audio clips at the same time, process the sound of all playing audio clips and send the final audio to the master mixer.

## Creation

To create a new audio track, we just need to call its constructor.

```cs
var track = new AudioTrack();
// optionally, you can assign a name to the track e.g new AudioTrack("MyTrack")
```

## Parameters

There are some parameters we can customize.

### Tweakable parameters

Here is a list of the tweakable audio tracks parameters:

- `Muted`: changes the track mute state. If the track is muted, no sound will be heard.
- `Name`: represents the name of the track.
- `Pan`: panning amount of the track (how much the sound should be heard from left and right). Ranges from -50 (100% left) to +50 (100% right). Default value is zero.
- `Volume`: volume of the track in dB. Ranges from -90 (completely silent) to +6 (clipping). Default value is zero.

### Not tweakable parameters

Here is a list of not tweakable audio tracks parameters:

- `Clips`: list of audio clips contained in the audio track.
- `IsAudioTrack`: indicates if the track is an audio track.
- `IsMidiTrack`: indicates if the track is a midi track.
- `IsTrackGroup`: indicates if the track is a track group.
- `IsInGroup`: indicates if the track is inside a track group.
- `IsRecording`: indicates if the track is recording.
- `PluginEffects`: list of effects plugins in the audio track.
- `PluginInstrument`: not used by audio tracks.
- `TrackGroup`: the track group of the track if any.
- `LeftChannelGain`: the current gain of the left audio channel for the track.
- `RightChannelGain`: the current gain of the right audio channel for the track.

## Operations

We can do some operations with audio tracks. Here is a list:

- `AddClip()`: adds an audio clip to the track.
- `AddPlugin()`: adds a plugin to the track.
- `RemoveAllClips()`: removes all audio clips from the track.
- `RemoveAllPlugins()`: removes all plugins from the track.
- `SwapFxPlugins`: swaps two effect plugins by index.
- `RemoveClip()`: removes a specific clip from the track.
- `RemovePlugin()`: removes a specific plugin from the track.
- `StartRecording()`: starts recording audio from the input device.
- `StopRecording()`: stops recording, saves the file and returns a new audio clip created from the record. (the clip will be added to the recording track)
- `StopSounds()`: stops all playing audio clips of the track.

<Aside type="note">
  We obviously cannot add midi clips or plugin instruments into audio tracks.
  Doing so results in an error message you can read from
  the `OperationResult` instance you get from calling the methods.

See the examples below for guidance.

### Examples

#### Adding audio clip to track and playing it

```cs
var track = new AudioTrack(); // Create an audio track
var audioClip = new AudioClip("path/to/sound.wav"); // Create an audio clip
var result = track.AddClip(audioClip); // Try add the clip to the track
if (!result.IsSuccess)
{
    // Print the error message if the clip couldn't be added
    Console.WriteLine($"Couldn't add clip to track: {result.Message}");
}
audioClip.Play(); // Start the clip playback.
```

#### Recording from input device and creating a clip from it

```cs
var track = new AudioTrack(); // Create an audio track

// Start recording audio from the selected windows input device and specify the path where the .wav file will be saved
track.StartRecording("path/to/recording.wav");

// Stop recording, save the file and return a new audio clip created from the recording
var recClip = track.StopRecording();
```

## Events

There are some events we can subscribe to in order to execute certain actions when something happens.

- `ClipAdded`: called when a clip has been added to the track.
- `ClipRemoved`: called when a clip has been removed from the track.
- `PluginAdded`: called when a plugin has been added to the track.
- `PluginRemoved`: called when a plugin has been removed from the track.
- `VolumeMeasured`: provides volume metering data all the time.

### Example

In this example we print the name of the clip that has been added to the track.

```cs
var audioTrack = new AudioTrack();
audioTrack.ClipAdded += (sender, e) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Clip {e.Clip.Name} has been added to the track.");
};
